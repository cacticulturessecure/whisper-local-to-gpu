I've just, I've got an op with them at Generac and I feel like they're, it's the type of thing where I feel like I'm eating into their budget of projects they already have that they're trying to post, if that makes sense.\nSo it's like I tried to bring him in, I had a good op, and then it fell off the face. And I kind of, I know the guy Oz, because I golfed with him at one of their events, and we had an opportunity prior with him that I was like, hey, let me bring you guys in here. Like, I met Oz at this event, but we had a prior op. And he just said he hasn't, they didn't push us at all. So, yeah. No, their loss is your win. Hey, I love it.\nyou know, the opposite is true of Ahead with Guidepoint, where I run into them all the time. I would say they are my largest competitor right now. Yeah, and they're, I think, a big Cloudflare shop, personally, so I'm kind of like, I don't know, I tried to bring them into Ashley, and they went with Ahead instead, and so I think there's some, like, feeling like I fucked them\npeople are weird yeah um but yeah nothing much else on my side um i do have that kind of platform like almost ready for testing if you want to start playing with it at any point i'd say your sales thing that you built yeah oh dude i would love that and i mean i yeah that would be super cool\nOkay. Do you guys, really quick while you pull that up, do you guys, did I share with you the recent Akamai shit show that I had? No. You guys are a direct competitor with Akamai, right? Yeah, and we crush them performance-wise. They're just, it's such a hard technology to get out unless they have a reason. They are freaking terrible, dude. Yeah. They're dead to us.\nbut we completely blew up our partnership and it's based on no name we never sold akamai um but their acquisition of no name dude they are completely dead to us and i am on a freaking mission to replace them wherever i can because they basically told me part of this contract uh and it was with patterson actually they they said in two years ago when patterson purchased no name\nfor an optional year two and three. Well, Akamai acquired them. They hired a rep who I, I'm just going to say it, I despise that I've worked with at other companies. And anyway, she ended up getting on a call with me after blowing me off for like six weeks to tell me, yep, we're not going to honor the contract. Price is going up by 250%. Yeah. And so those are the situations like we typically see them come in or that we kind of get brought in is like,\nEither it's something performance-based where, like in Ashley, to where we're more performant, or like a streaming service, or like insurance banking to where there's a cost value where we save them on egress compared to what they're doing with Akamai. But the other reason is they get price hiked, or a lot of times their services, if they want to modify anything, they have to work with Akamai, which then they get charged pro services on the top of it. So it's the type of\nover a 10-year period they've just done that price hike and then they're at that point or they do it eventually um and that's kind of where we get our business yeah well i i just my thing is like you want to raise your prices by all means i love selling expensive products uh but if it's contracted dude it's not up for debate you know like you wrote it in the quote and therefore i wrote it in the quote to the customer and it's part of the contract it is what it is sorry you're a new rep\nwhere all your clients are have already purchased and you only get comped on new business not mine or the customers problem yeah no exactly I'll have to show you next time I've got Linux on my machine and I can't I can't get to screen share on it I'll show it to you next time though yeah but it's just like you know it's more personal curiosity yeah no it's not it's just something I'll give you like a\ncredentials and then you can just play around with it um if you see value in it you know let me know it's not something i'm trying to sell it's just something i use for personal stuff dude i mean if it gets to a point where it's fully baked and sellable i hope you do sell it i will but i feel like i'm like probably two years out from that still but it's gonna be it's gonna be cool i think you'll like it so i'll send you a link in like two weeks however i can we'll make it happen\nThat's awesome. Yeah, I'm very curious and I play with AI all the time. I play with programming and it'd be cool to see something actually functional. Yeah, I think you'll like where it's at. I'll let you know probably two weeks. I'll shoot you a link. Sweet, dude. That's awesome. All right, Bobby. Well, yeah, let me know how everything turns out. I hope end of the quarter goes well. You too.\nSounds great, Chris. Always great catching up with you, man, and talk to you very soon. You too, man. Take care. Bye. Bye. That's all you're going to do. Just be fine. How was that? Good. You approved? Mm-hmm. I'm not approved.\n\u306f\u3044\n\u3054\u8996\u8074\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\nOh\n\u304a\u3084\u3059\u307f\u306a\u3055\u3044\nOkay, can I tell you what I'm annoyed now? Yeah.\nOh, so she's like, oh, did you order these things? And I'm like, no, he never told me to. And she's like, I'm pretty sure he didn't. No, he didn't. She's like, well, I think I did. But I must have gotten lost in the shuffle. And I like looked back and she never did. I just don't like that. I don't know either.\nShe never got a approval from you. Like, dude, don't tell me I fucked up and I didn't fuck up. Yeah. Like, you need to own your shit, wouldn't you? She's like, it's okay, we got a million things. I'm like, but I didn't forget. Yeah, exactly. It's the key. It's like, dude. Like, I found it in the messages. I like, almost want to send her a screenshot, but I'm not going to. I know what you mean. I send the screenshots. Do you? Yeah. Should I send it? I'm not going to. I think it's kind of a dick move that I do it. I know. I wouldn't do it with Sasha.\nI'm not going to.\n\u306f\u3044\nSigh.\nso\n\u306f\u3044"
